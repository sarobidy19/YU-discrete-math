Welcome to the York University Discrete Mathematics seminar. During the Winter 2025 term, the seminar will be on Wednesday every two weeks at 2:00 PM, Ontario time. Location: [N501/Ross, York University](https://www.google.com/maps/dir//Toronto,+ON+M3J+1P3/@43.7722137,-79.5861929,12z/data=!4m8!4m7!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x882b2e2562b62519:0x7d29e594af98aab4!2m2!1d-79.5037922!2d43.7722433?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MDkxOC4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D).

**Speaker:** [Thomás Jung Spier](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~thomasjung/) (University of Waterloo)

**Date and time:** April 7 at 1:30 PM.

**Location:** N638/Ross, York University

**Title:** *Perfect state transfer in chains*

**Abstract:**

In this talk, we present some advances in the problem of classifying all possible vertex positions in a chain involved in perfect state transfer. We also show that this problem is related to the Prouhet-Tarry-Escott problem in number theory. This is a joint work with Frederico Cançado, Gabriel Coutinho, Alastair Kay and Harmony Zhan.

**Speaker:** [Gill Barequet](https://barequet.cs.technion.ac.il/) (Technion -- Israel Inst. of Technology)

**Date and time:** March 14 at 2:00 PM.

**Location:** N638/Ross, York University

**Title:** *Polycubes with small perimeter defect* 

**Abstract:** Lattice animals are connected sets of cells on a lattice.  For example, *polyominoes* are connected sets of cells on the planar square lattice, where connectivity is through edges (sides of the squares).
One of the main problems in this area is finding a formula for the number of animals (or for the number of members of some family of animals) on some lattice.

In this talk, I will explore methods for setting formulae for the number of animals on the $$d$$-dimensional cubical lattice, whose perimeter deviates by a fixed constant from the maximum possible perimeter.
 
Joint work with Andrei Asinowski (Alpen-Adria-Universität Klagenfurt) and Yufei Zheng (UMass Amherst).

**Date and time:** February 12 at 2:00 PM.

**Location:** N501/Ross, York University

**Title:** *Maximum spread of graphs* 

**Abstract:** *Given a graph $$G$$, let $$\lambda_1$$  and $$\lambda_n$$ be the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix and define the spread of $$G$$ to be $$\lambda_1-\lambda_n$$. In this talk we discuss solutions to a 20-year-old conjecture of Gregory, Hershkowitz, and Kirkland regarding the spread of graphs. Our proofs use techniques from the theory of graph limits (graphons) and numerical analysis, including a computer-assisted proof of a finite-dimensional eigenvalue problem using both interval arithmetic and symbolic computations.*

**Title:** *A Hilton-Milner theorem for exterior algebras* 

**Abstract:** *The now-classical theorem of Erdős, Ko and Rado from 1961 says that the largest pairwise-intersecting families of k-sets are the ones where all the members share a fixed element, and with slightly stronger hypothesis these are the only maximal families. These families are called trivial families. Hilton and Milner in 1967 proved the next best upper-bound, that is they provided an upper bound for the size of non-trivial pairwise intersecting families of k-sets. These theorems have been generalized to several scenarios where there is a notion of intersection such as simplicial complexes, permutations, matrices, vector spaces, to name a few. In this talk I will focus on subspaces of the exterior algebra where the analog of being pairwise-intersecting is called self-annihilating. Scott and Wilmer '21, and Woodroofe '22 proved an upper-bound on the dimension of self-annihilating subspaces of the exterior algebra and conjectured that the characterization part of the  Erdős, Ko and Rado theorem should hold as well. We proved this conjecture. Moreover, we prove a Hilton-Milner type upper-bound for non-trivial self-annihilating subspaces.This is a joint work with Francesca Gandini and Russ Woodroofe.*
