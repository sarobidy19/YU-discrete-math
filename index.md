**Title:** On cocliques in a Cayley graph of $$\operatorname{GL}_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$$ generated by matrices with eigenvalue $$-1$$


**Abstract:** *Let $$q$$ be a prime power and $$n\geq 2$$ an integer. Consider the graph $$\Gamma_q(n)$$ whose vertex set is $$\operatorname{GL}_{n}({\mathbb{F}_q})$$, and where two distinct elements $$A$$ and $$B$$ of $$\operatorname{GL}_{n}(\mathbb{F}_{q})$$ are adjacent if $$A+B$$ is singular. In [Linear Algebra Appl. 681 (2024):89--96], it was recently shown by Nica that $$\alpha(\Gamma_q(n))\leq q^{n^2-n+1}$$ for all values of $$q$$.*

*In this talk, I will show that Nica's bound can be significantly improved in some cases. First, I will show for $$q$$ a power of $$2$$ that $$\alpha(\Gamma_q(n)) = {q^n-1}$$. Then for the $$2$$-dimensional case, I will show that $$\alpha(\Gamma_q(2)) \leq \frac{q(q-1)^2}{2}$$, when $$q$$ is odd.*

**Title:** Using binary trees to count a special class of lattice paths


**Abstract:** *After an introduction to NE (North, East) lattice paths, we rotate our frame of reference into UD (Up, Down) lattice paths and add a '(max) height' constraint.  We count NE lattice paths by two methods: first by encoding the steps as binary strings (a simple counting problem to solve); second by repeatedly applying Pascal's recurrence to generate a decision tree, which can be carefully transformed back into a lattice grid.  While logically circular for NE paths, this second method is surprisingly helpful for counting height-restricted UD paths.  After one more reflection, we see that the UD path problem is equivalent to an NE lattice with different dimensions, deriving a nice, closed form!  We close by considering some other bivariate sequences to see how far we can generalize the method.  Results on height-restricted UD paths come from work on a recent submission by Acton, Petersen, Shirman, and Tenner [https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11680](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11680).*
