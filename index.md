# Fall 2024



**Speaker:**  Blake Shirman (York University)

**Date and time:** September 26 at 10:30 AM.

**Location:** N638/Ross, York University

**Title:** Using binary trees to count a special class of lattice paths

**Abstract:** *After an introduction to NE (North, East) lattice paths, we rotate our frame of reference into UD (Up, Down) lattice paths and add a '(max) height' constraint.  We count NE lattice paths by two methods: first by encoding the steps as binary strings (a simple counting problem to solve); second by repeatedly applying Pascal's recurrence to generate a decision tree, which can be carefully transformed back into a lattice grid.  While logically circular for NE paths, this second method is surprisingly helpful for counting height-restricted UD paths.  After one more reflection, we see that the UD path problem is equivalent to an NE lattice with different dimensions, deriving a nice, closed form!  We close by considering some other bivariate sequences to see how far we can generalize the method.  Results on height-restricted UD paths come from work on a recent submission by Acton, Petersen, Shirman, and Tenner [https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11680](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11680).*
